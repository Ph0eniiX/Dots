TODO LIST FOR THIS PROJECT:

Next Version:
 - Dots that surround a rectangular screen (kinda like the short lines option for TicToc+)
 - Some sort of battery indicator (a unique one maybe, a dot that changes color as the battery drains)
 - Some way to show the date 
 - BT disconnect buzz

Future versions:
 - Animations!
 - i'll add more here once i think of stuff
